# 🧠 LeetCode Practice – jonboy_319

This repo is my personal collection of coding challenges and problem-solving practice using **Python** and **JavaScript**.

I'm focusing on:
- Strengthening my algorithm and data structure skills
- Rewriting each solution in both Python 🐍 and JavaScript 🟨
- Thinking like a developer and improving problem-solving techniques
