## ğŸ§ª Pseudocode (Before Coding)

- Loop through the array
- For each number, check every number after it
- If a pair adds up to the target, return their indexes
- If no pair found, return None

## ğŸš¨ Edge Cases

- Only 2 numbers in array â†’ must be the answer
- Negative numbers or zero included
- Target cannot be made â†’ should return None

## ğŸ˜µ What Tripped Me Up

- Forgot proper syntax for JS loops
- Confused `.len()` with `.length`
- Didn't think about comparing every pair, not just the next one

## ğŸ§  Dev Thinking

- Should I brute-force or optimize?
- What data structure could make this faster?
- Can I trade space for time?
